===========================================================================

Theme Notes
------------
The sbcs Theme is a child of TwentyEleven theme. I overrode the header and footer to suit the desired look and feel for
the site and added templates and sidebars for the various subpages.



Plugin Notes
-------------
The sbcs plugin provides two widgets for the St. Bernard's website. One is a generic HTML widget that allows the user to
easily insert a chunk of HTML for display in a sidebar or footer. The other shows a variety of predefined informational
widgets cadged from the original website.
